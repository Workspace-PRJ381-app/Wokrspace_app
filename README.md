 ## [Introduction] 
 <br>
 Our motivation behind the project is to tackle the workforce balancing problem. Anyone who is 
actively looking for a job or even employers will be able to use the application. The focus of this project 
is to make it easier for employers to find suitable employees. Users will also be able to create a 
professional profile. Their profile will contain their interests, strengths, and weaknesses along with a 
curriculum vitae of the user only visible to verified organizations. The application will notify users 
when a job opportunity they might be interested in has appeared near them or in their area.

 ## Devolpment Rules and Coding Standards
 
 It is important the there are coding standards and rules to ensure that the quality of code and consistency within the code is always present
 
 **Programming Rules:**
- Ensure that your code is readable
- consistency in the naming of variables and functions
- names must make sense
- no innapropriate variable names ( nothing racist, sexual or rude in any way )
- Naming conventions(This applies to variables, files, functions):
    - files should be named consistently
    - file names should be short but descriptive (< 25 characters)
    - Avoid special characters or spaces in a file name
    - use capitals and underscores instead of periods or spaces or slashes
    - use date format ISO 8601: YYYYMMDD
    - Include a version number
    - Write down naming convention in data management plan
    - Hierarchical file structures
    - Make use of **camelCase** or **PascalCase**, remain within these naming conventions where possible

 **Testing Rules**:
- When making a testing account make use of the existing testing account to sign in : test@test.com ( this works for both worker and client sides)
