 ## [Introduction] 
 <br>
 Our motivation behind the project is to tackle the workforce balancing problem. Anyone who is 
actively looking for a job or even employers will be able to use the application. The focus of this project 
is to make it easier for employers to find suitable employees. Users will also be able to create a 
professional profile. Their profile will contain their interests, strengths, and weaknesses along with a 
curriculum vitae of the user only visible to verified organizations. The application will notify users 
when a job opportunity they might be interested in has appeared near them or in their area.
